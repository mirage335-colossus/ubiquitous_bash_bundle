# MetaEngine and Queue

Need to connect multiple output files/pipes/buffers to another program with multiple input files/pipes/buffers? MetaEngine is an efficient framework to create such complex 'pipelines' .

Need to share data from a program or serial device (eg. VR controllers, 3D printer motors, etc) with several other programs or devices, and maybe the existing 'HID' drivers are not flexible enough? Emulate a 'shared pair of wires' with 'queue', and send a packet. Both 'tripleBuffer' and automatic connection of multiple 'pipes' are available as backends. For less real-time purposes, 'interactive' and 'database' backends exist as well.

Compatible with UNIX/MSW(/Cygwin) . Portable on all platforms (including portable Cygwin installation) . Anchor '*.bat' 'shortcuts' are simultaneously executable as both 'batch' and "bash" scripts, comment characters being appropriately interpreted for each.

Run '_test.bat' on UNIX/MSW(/Cygwin) to fully test MetaEngine and Queue , among other things.




Example MetaEngine code . Example commands included in 'README.md' .

Example '_page' ( 'tripleBuffer' ) Inter-Process Communication. Example commands included in 'scrap.txt' . Tests included in 'ubiquitous_bash.sh' may be run with '_test.bat' or similar.
